# Tiger Neo N-type 78HL4-(V)
## 615-635 Watt BIFACIAL MODULE (Grade B )



- **Bifacial Technology**: Capable of capturing light on both sides of the panel for increased energy yield.
- **SMBB Technology**: Better light trapping and current collection to improve module power output and reliability.
- **N-Type**: Superior performance and durability compared to traditional P-type modules.
- **Enhanced Mechanical Load**: Certified to withstand wind load (2400 Pascal) and snow load (5400 Pascal).
- **PID Resistance**: Excellent Anti-PID performance guarantee via optimized mass-production process and materials control.
- **Hot 2.0 Technology**: Better reliability and lower LID/LETID.
- **Durability Against Extreme Environmental Conditions**: High salt mist and ammonia resistance.

### Grade B Classification

These panels are classified as Grade B due to minor cosmetic imperfections. These imperfections do not affect the performance or reliability of the panels. Examples of cosmetic issues may include:

- Small scratches on the frame
- Minor colour variations in cells
- Slight misalignment of cell patterns
- Small bubbles in the encapsulant (not affecting performance)

All electrical and performance specifications remain identical to Grade A panels.
